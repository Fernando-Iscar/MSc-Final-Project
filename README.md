## Salary Prediction and Bias exploration in the AI/ML Field

## Project definition, Motivation & Relevance

This project explores salary predictions within the rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) domains. Prior research has primarily focused on compensation trends across different industries and gender pay disparities, with a lack of extensive study into the AI-ML sectors. This research aims to fill that gap by comparing both conventional and advanced regression methods to identify the most suitable model to predict salaries in the AI-ML sector. The study also seeks to investigate biases in prediction error and identify key features and discriminatory patterns.

The research carries societal significance as it promotes fair employment practices and sheds light on compensation biases within the AI-ML field. In addition to societal relevance, the study holds scientific value as it addresses the research gap on salary prediction in the AI-ML field, compares performance of multiple regression methods, and contributes to the understanding of wage prediction.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent is it possible to explain more variance and reduce prediction
errors from a baseline model consisting of the features `Country`, `Job
type`, `Education`, `Job title`, `Company size`, `Age`, `Experience` and
`Annual Salary` by using different **ML** and **DL** algorithms such as **MLR**, **Lasso**, **Ridge**, **SVR**,
**Adaboost**, **RF**,  **XGBoost**, and **MLP**?

2. Selecting the best overall performer regression algorithm from the baseline
model, how do additional features, including `Remote work`, `Certifications`, `Coding as a hobby`, `Gender`, `Sexual orientation`, `Ethnicity`,
"Physical disability", and "Mental disability", impact the prediction error
and variance explained by the aforementioned model?‚Äù

3. To what extent can patterns of discrimination be detected after including
`Gender`, `Sexual orientation`, `Ethnicity`, `Physical disability` and
`Mental disability` in the previously introduced baseline model?
