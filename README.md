## Salary Prediction and Bias exploration in the AI/ML Field

### Project definition, Motivation & Relevance

This project explores salary predictions within the rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) domains. Prior research has primarily focused on compensation trends across different industries and gender pay disparities, with a lack of extensive study into the AI-ML sectors. 

This research aims to fill that gap by comparing both conventional and advanced regression methods to identify the most suitable model to predict salaries in the AI-ML sector. The study also seeks to investigate biases in prediction error and identify key features and discriminatory patterns.

The research carries societal significance as it promotes fair employment practices and sheds light on compensation biases within the AI-ML field. In addition to societal relevance, the study holds scientific value as it addresses the research gap on salary prediction in the AI-ML field, compares performance of multiple regression methods, and contributes to the understanding of wage prediction.

### Research Questions

1. Utilizing traditional predictors like “Country”, “Job type”, “Education”,
“Job title”, “Company size”, “Age”, “Experience”, and “Annual Salary”,
how do various ML and DL algorithms such as MLR, LASSO, RIDGE,
RF, XGBoost, and MLP perform in terms of prediction error and variance
explained against a median-based baseline?

2. Selecting the best overall performer regression algorithm from the RQ1, how
do additional features, including "Remote work", "Certifications", "Coding
as a hobby", "Years Coding", "Gender", "Sexual orientation", "Ethnicity",
"Physical disability", and "Mental disability", impact the prediction error
and variance explained by the aforementioned model?

3. By integrating attributes like "Gender", "Sexual orientation", "Ethnicity",
"Physical disability", and "Mental disability" into the model, to what extent
can potential patterns of discrimination be identified?
